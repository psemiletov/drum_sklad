Notes by Peter Semiletov for Dramlabooh kit version:

1. All samples were converted from 44kHz/24 bit integer/stereo to 44kHz/float 32/mono.
2. Instruments order was slightly changed.
3. This kit uses Round Robin and Random Switch options, so incompatible with Drumrox drum plugin (the predecessor of Drumlabooh)
