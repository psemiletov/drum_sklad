Sequential Circuits Drumtraks samples

These samples are all 16 bit 44,100 Hz Mono wavs. I tuned all the drums to the center of the 16 step tuning range except for the toms which I sampled at two different tunings. This is because the drumtraks has two incidences of the same tom sample you can tune differently.I am pretty sure these are the factory samples that came with my Drumtraks in 1983.

"The DrumTraks is a very programmable classic drum machine from the eighties. While its electronic drum kit sounds may not be as popular today as the TR-909 or TR-808, the DrumTraks exceeds them with superior editing capabilities. Thirteen drum sounds all with programmable tuning and level control. Extensive editing with copy and paste ability. There's even a mixer section for individual sounds, six individual outputs, one mono mix output, and cassette in/out for offline memory storage."
