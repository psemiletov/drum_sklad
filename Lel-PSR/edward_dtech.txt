ЛЕЛЬ ПСР (Lel PSR) soviet Rhythm Machine samples, directly converted from its WaveROMs.

For some weird reason, nobody else seemed to have desoldered and dumped all the roms from this soviet drum machine. So I had to do it, and share them with you :)

Samples are converted from binary images in a lossless way into 8bit RAWs using my own tool, and then converted into WAVs. Excessive zero tails (when present) were trimmed.

Filenames match ROM chip names, and have added numbers in case there were two samples in a single ROM chip.
The lelpsr_h12.wav contains both H1 and H2 ROM data, as open hihat sample spans two ROMs.

Load, sample and enjoy!
And please give a credit or a link to my website, whenever applicable.


Original data dates back to September 21, 1989.
