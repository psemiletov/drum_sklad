Cheetah SpecDrum, the Standard kit

Year: 1985
Number of samples: 8

Cheetah SpecDrum was the hardware device and the software program for ZX Spectrum. It has additional drimkits (Afro, Electro, Latin) with a price £3.99-£4.99. The device cost was £29.95. The samples were loaded from the cassete to Spectrum's RAM, and 8-bit SpecDrum hardware was similar to Covox, so Cheetah SpecDrum can play sound to Covox by changing the device port.
