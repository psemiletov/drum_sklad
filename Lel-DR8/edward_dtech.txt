Лель DR-8 (Lel' DR-8) soviet Rhythm Machine samples, directly converted from its WaveROMs.

For your listening (and sampling) pleasure, I added a converted version of the WaveROMs in a WAV file.
I would appreciate a credit or link (where applicable), if you happen to use these samples somewhere.


Original data dates back to 1993.
